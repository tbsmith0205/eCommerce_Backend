## Description

This project uses MySQL and Sequelize packages to connect the Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data. 

## Installation
The user must have both Node.js and MySQL installed. The user must clone the repo by running: git clone git@github.com:tbsmith0205/eCommerce_Backend.git in the command line. Then the user must navigate into the root directory and run an npm i to install all packages. Once that is done, start the server by typing npm start in the command line.
